# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremor, muscle rigidity and slow, imprecise movement often affecting middle aged and elderly members of the society. The idea of this project is to use a random forest regressor to predict the whether person is going to suffer with the disease or not.
